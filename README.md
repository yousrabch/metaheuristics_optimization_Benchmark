# TP – Metaheuristics

**TP – Metaheuristics** is an interactive web application built with **Streamlit** that allows you to explore **continuous optimization benchmark problems** using metaheuristic algorithms. The app lets you generate candidate solutions, evaluate their fitness, and visualize 3D landscapes of standard test functions.

## Features

- **Benchmark Functions:**  
  Includes standard continuous optimization problems such as:
  - Sphere (F1)
  - Schwefel (F2, F8)
  - Rosenbrock (F5)
  - Quartic + Noise (F7)
  - Rastrigin (F9)
  - Griewank (F11)  

- **Candidate Solution Generation:**  
  Generate random solutions within a selected range or manually input your own solution vector.

- **Fitness Evaluation:**  
  Compute the value of the chosen benchmark function for any candidate solution.

- **Interactive 3D Visualization:**  
  Explore 2D cross-sections of the functions with **Plotly surfaces**, rotate the 3D landscape, and zoom to inspect minima and maxima.
